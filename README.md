# Wi-Fi Touch and OLED Display Demo
<img src="images/IoT-Made-Easy-Logo.png" width=100>

> "Wireless Made Easy!" - This example application acts as a TCP Server to which a TCP Client can connect and visualize QT7 Touch Xpro data. The touch data are also printed on an OLED Display.

Devices: **WFI32E01**

**Watch the video and see in action this All-in-one application running on WFI32E Curiosity board**

## Software requirement

The sample project has been created and tested with the following Software Development Tools:
- MPLAB X IDE v6.00
- MPLAB XC32 v3.01
- MPLAB Harmony v3.6.4
   - mhc v3.8.2
   - csp v3.10.0
   - core v3.10.0
   - wireless_wifi v3.6.1
   - dev_packs v3.10.0
   - touch v3.11.0
   - wireless_system_pic32mzw1_wfi32e01 v3.6.1
   - wolfssl v4.7.0
   - net v3.7.4
   - crypto v3.7.5
   - CMSIS-FreeRTOS v10.3.1


## Hardware setup using the WFI32 Curiosity Board

- Connect [QT7 Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atqt7-xpro) to Xpro Header of the WFI32E Curiosity board
- **J211** jumper shorted between pin 2-3 to get IRQ line
- **J209** open that disconnect on-board temperature sensor thus one of the slider Y-line is sharing the same pin

- Order the [OLED W click board](https://www.mikroe.com/oled-w-click)
- Make sure the **RST** pin of the [OLED W click](https://www.mikroe.com/oled-w-click) is not connected to the WFI32 Curiosity board (RB6 signal) but connected to a permanent 3.3V (here connected to J402 3V3_IN).\
The RB6 signal is already connected to the QT7 Xplained Pro board and used for the Capacitive Touch Driven Shield.

With this modification, the WFI32 does not control the RESET line of the OLED W click and the display is ON all the time.

## OLED W click

The [OLED W click](https://www.mikroe.com/oled-w-click) carries a 96 x 39px white monochrome passive matrix OLED display. The display is bright, has a wide viewing angle and low power consumption. To drive the display, [OLED W click](https://www.mikroe.com/oled-w-click) features an [SSD1306](https://www.solomon-systech.com/en/product/display-ic/oled-driver-controller/ssd1306/) controller. Check out the [SSD1306 datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/SSD1306.pdf) for more details.

In this demo, the [OLED W click](https://www.mikroe.com/oled-w-click) communicates with the WFI32 MCU through SPI lines.
